Tryal 

Our mission is to accelerate medical research by empowering everyday people to get involved with research on their own terms. Tryal will be a personalized mobile platform to attract, encourage, and educate participants in order to expand the research recruiting pool while developing involved and eager participants. 

Our product functions like a job-search app, dating app or social media app, rather than a clinical trial website. Tryal is easy to use, customized to the userâ€™s preferences, quickly capable of matching users to suitable studies, and uses custom chat features to enhance the relationship between participant and researcher.
